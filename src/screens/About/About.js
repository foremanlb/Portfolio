      <h2 id='about-title'>Software Engineer</h2>
      <p id='about-body'>My name is Craig Navarro and I am a software engineer.  I have a passion for front end and design, but enjoy all aspects of development.<br /><br />
      I enjoy problem solving, both at work and at home.  Whether it's finding a solution for my code or figuring out a new way to solve a puzzle in a game.<br /><br />
      Being an avid researcher of anything that catches my fancy, I'm constantly looking for new and better ways of accomplishing tasks.<br /><br />
      Most of my professional career has been in sales, from items as small as a single light bulb, to vehicles limited to under 5,000 made.  My experiences have taught me a few, very important lessons.  Something as menial as a light bulb can have a multitude of facets that can change the overall effectiveness, leading me to not take anything, no matter how minor it may seem, for granted.  Selling vehicles, both high end and starter vehicles, has taught me that no matter who the customer is, they all pay attention to the details of what they are buying, so I should pay attention to the details as well, no matter the scope of the project I come across.<br /><br />
      I have worked alone and apart of a team, both as a follower and a leader.  I have the ability to conform to most any environment I am put into, and would be an asset to any team I become a part of.</p>
